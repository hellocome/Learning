First Steps
First Steps to Scala Article
Setup a Scala development environment (including Eclipse support)
Get the Scala Language Distro
Get the Eclipse Scala IDE
Don’t like Eclipse? There’s also JetBrains’ IntelliJ IDEA Scala
Use the REPL - it’ll be your best friend and a great way to learn and try out syntax.
Try Scala Tour - interactive tour of the scala language
Try Scala for the Impatient - should be enough to get you started
Useful Links

What should be on your bookshelf
Programming In Scala 2nd Edition by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon and Bill Venners 
Definitive, but dare we say it, a little dry. That being said, it’s a text-book that’s worth reading.
[Scala in Depth by Joshua D. Suereth] (http://www.manning.com/suereth/) 
Excellent book for more advanced topics - don’t start with this - but when you are ready, read it, then read it again.
DSLs in Action by Debasish Ghosh
Covers DSLs very well in Ruby, Groovy, Scala and Clojure (Scala gets a lot of coverage). Also covers External DSLs with Scala parser combinators generating case class models
Scala Courses
Some excellent free Coursera courses are available. They are 7 weeks long, so it’s a commitment, but worth it. Start with the Functional Programming Principles - this teaches functional programming through Scala.

Functional Programming Principles in Scala
Principles of Reactive Programming
Tips
[Between Zero & Hero Tips] (https://speakerdeck.com/agemooij/between-zero-and-hero-scala-tips-and-tricks-for-the-intermediate-scala-developer) - Age Mooij’s Scala Tips and Tricks for the intermediate Scala developer

[Twitter’s coding standards] (http://twitter.github.com/effectivescala/)
“Scala In Depth” by Joshua D. Suereth - Chapters 2+3 - This contains some good advice similar to “Effective Java”
[Zen of Python] (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) - provides some good general principles for succinct coding styles, these apply equally well to Scala code
Practising Scala
We would advise beginners to start with unit-testing their existing Java code in Scala. It’s a useful and non-threatening way to start getting to grips with the syntax. Have a look at ScalaTest or Specs2
Scalatron a programming game that can help with learning Scala
Some puzzles that can be useful as well - Ninety-Nine Scala Problems
Functional Programming
[Introduction to Functional Programming] (http://jsuereth.com/intro-to-fp)
This is an excellent presentation that shows how functional programming simplifies using APIs and Futures
